HealthTrack is a mobile-friendly web application designed to provide basic medical guidance and clinic referrals based on user-reported symptoms. Built for a hackathon focusing on SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-being), 4 (Quality Education), and 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities), its goal is to make preliminary healthcare advice more accessible and reduce unnecessary strain on medical facilities.
